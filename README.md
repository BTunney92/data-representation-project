# data-representation-project

A (very) basic voting app to rank the best goals in World Cup history.

Hosted @ http://127.0.0.1:5000

App.py creates the flask application.

VoteDao connects to mysql to create database and record votes.

Vote.html allows the  user to view the goals and cast their vote.

Results.html will then display the results.
