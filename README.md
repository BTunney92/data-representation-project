# data-representation-project

A (very) basic voting app to rank the best goals in World Cup history.

Hosted @ http://127.0.0.1:5000

App.py creates the flask application and sets up the database.

Vote.html allows the  user to view the goals and cast their vote.

Results.html will then display the results.
